# MagePractice
## Magento 2 good practices, based on community input.

### Description
There's a wealth of knowledge on the Interwebs for working with Magento 1 and Magento 2, but it's scattered and not necessarily centralized. There's a list of "go-to people" and a list of "go-to resources" that we each have, but maybe we could do better?

#### There's official resources like 
- The [Magento forum](https://community.magento.com/)
- The [DevDocs](https://devdocs.magento.com/) (which are better than anything we ever had for Magento 1 )
- The [DevBlog](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/bg-p/devblog)
- The [Magento Community Engineering Slack](magentocommeng.slack.com)
- etc.

#### Others: 
- [Mage2.tv](https://www.mage2.tv/) ( which is really great )
- [Alan Storm](https://alanstorm.com/category/magento-2/)
- [Aleron75's Mageres](https://github.com/aleron75/mageres)
- [Magento Stackexchange](https://magento.stackexchange.com/)
- Twitter
- etc.

These resources are either in the format of question/answer forums/boards, lists of resources, or educational. There are various excellent blogs/websites that periodically publish posts on ways of accomplishing Magento 2 work, but these aren't always readily known to the community at large.

### In the beginning:
- It all started here, with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/brentwpeterson/status/1051462564104871936) and discussion stemming from Brent W. Peterson.

### Problems with the current state of things:
- Seemingly disperate resources across the Interwebs versus a trustworthly and centralized source of knowledge driven by community input and experience
- Magento 2 has ushered in an updated tech stack and a new way of doing things, which means learning new things/ways of doing things for members of the community

### Ideas:
- For standard PHP, there exists [phptherightway](https://phptherightway.com/). There was a similar effort for [Magento 1](https://magentotherightway.com/) which doesn't address Magento 2, and hasn't seen activity for a while. So possibly something to fill in this void.

- Collaborate on a community-owned and community-driven resource which cataloges ways of working with Magento 2 that have proven to work, so that this knowledge can be captured and made visible to the community at large.
